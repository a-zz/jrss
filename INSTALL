[Template INSTALL file, customize accordingly]

..:: INITIAL SETUP ::..
Before the first build we should take a few minutes setting up our local
installation. That means at least:

i. Copying source/web/WEB-INF/log4j2.xml to config/web/WEB-INF/ and editing the
later to fit our needs and customize logging file path.

i. Copying source/web/WEB-INF/local.properties to config/web/WEB-INF/ and 
editing the later to fit our needs. At least the path for our local (HSQLDB) 
database should be provided, as it will be created and populated at the first 
boot.

..:: BUILDING ::..
In a nutshell, provided we have:

> JDK 1.8, properly referred by the JAVA_HOME environment variable
> Apache Ant 1.9, properly accesible by the PATH environment variable
> (prior versions could work but, though not tested)

we should only need to enter the application directory and run:

  # ant

If everything runs fine, we should have a j2ee-deployable directory in

  deployable/skel-app/
  
CUSTOMIZING OUR INSTALLATION: THE BUILDING PROCCESS EXPLAINED

Basically, the application layout is:
  source/        - Source code, consisting of:
    java/		   - Compilable (Java) code 
    web/		   - Non-compilable code (web files)
  lib/			 - Libraries (mostly JARs) needed for compilation
  deployable/	 - This is where the deployable product is dropped, i.e.:
    skel-app/    - The j2ee-deployable application directory  
  config/		 - Persistent configuration directory, see below
  
The building process goes as this:

1. init - Set the build timestamp and the deployable target directory

2. layout - Set the application layout. This basically means copying the
	source/web directory as deployable/skel-app/
	
3. compile - Compile Java files to deployable/skel-app/WEB-INF/classes. JARs
	needed for this are found in the lib/ directory.
	
4. configure - Apply persistent configurations to the deployable application.
	Again, see below.
	
5. deployable - Final touches to the deployable application. Basically, copying 
	the JARs from lib/ to deployable/skel-app/WEB-INF/lib, and anything 
	else that should be neccesary.
	
Ok, it's time for the configuration step.

This application is intended to have a continuous integration cycle. That is:
update from the version control repository > build > deploy > go!; and do 
it often. Thus, local configuration files located within the deployable 
directory should be kept among checkouts. What we do is:

i. Place our configuration files under config/web/. That directory isn't
(shouldn't) be tracked by the version control system, so checkouts won't 
modify them.

2. The configuration step in the building process just copies / overwrites those
files from config/web/ to deployable/skel-app/, keeping their subdirectory 
locations, i.e.:

	config/						deployable/
		web/						skel-app/
			WEB-INF/					WEB-INF/
				a_file_here --------------> a_file_here
				
Thus, our configuration isn't lost among checkouts. In fact, this mechanism
can be used for any file we may want to keep apart, or locally-customize,
from the version control system, not only configuration files. But beware! 
New releases altering those files will need a proper reconfiguration under 
config/web/.

Also under config/ can be found the build/ subdirectory. That's intended for
local configurations affecting the build process. Currently none.

..:: DEPLOYMENT ::..
As said, when the build process is finished we have a j2ee-deployable 
directory in deployable/skel-app/. So, in order to deploy it we can:

i. copy it to the servlet container deployment directory (e.g. 
$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/); or

ii. if you're building on the target server, you can just place a symbolic link
under the servlet container deployment directory to deployable/skel-app/. This 
works like a charm on Linux, (and Mac Os X, supposedly) and it's our favourite 
approach; can't tell if it's feasible on Windows.

Alternatively, you can package the deployable directory as a WAR file just 
running:

  # ant war
  
That should produce a WAR file under deployable/.

..:: DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS ::..
We currently use Eclipse (Neon 3 or Oxygen) as IDE, so the guidelines below
apply to that environment. Other IDEs should work fine, though; their users
need to figure out how these guidelines apply to them.

Importing the project directory in Eclipse, building it with the builtin Ant 
tool and debugging it under an embedded server should be quite straightforward.
Those unwilling to mess with manual setup can rely on the "New Project > Java 
Project from Existing Ant Buildfile" wizard, which works pretty well.

Anyway, a few things worth saying:

i. An Ant build should be made before configuring the project Build Path in 
order to populate de deployable directory. Build Path output folder should be
deployable/skel-app/WEB-INF/classes/, so changes to Java files are hot-replaced
into the debugging application.

ii. Non-compilable web files are copied at build time from source/web/ to
deployable/skel-app/. Changes in the later directory are hot-replaced into the
debugging application, but are **not** tracked by GIT. Those changes must be
applied to source/web/ prior to committing. Eclipse compare tool works fine for
that. It's advisable to apply changes often in order to avoid local changes 
being destroyed by a later checkout and rebuild. The, the daily routine should
be:

  Apply pending changes to source/web/ > Git fetch and checkout > Ant build

iii. A .gitignore file is provided to avoid tracking of the deployable/ and 
config/ directories. It also avoids Eclipse project settings files; those using
an alternative IDE may want to customize that.
